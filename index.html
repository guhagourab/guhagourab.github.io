      Step 1: Planning and Goal Setting
    </h3>
    <p style="padding-top: 5pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: left"><br /></p>
    <p class="s1"
	style="

    >
      The first step in managing a new project is to plan and set clear goals.
      This involves identifying the project’s objectives, scope, timeline,
      budget, and stakeholders. I ensure that all stakeholders are aligned and
      informed about the project’s goals and expectations. This step is crucial
      in setting the foundation for the project’s success.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-top: 3pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: left"><br /></p>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 5pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: left">
      Step 2: Methodology Selection
    </h3>
    <p style="padding-top: 5pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: left"><br /></p>
    <p class="s1"
	style="
		padding-top: 4pt;
		padding-left: 5pt;
		text-indent: 0pt;
		line-height: 156%;
		text-align: justify;
	"
    >
      The next step is to select the appropriate project management methodology.
      For data science projects, I typically use Agile, as it allows for
      flexibility and adaptability in the face of uncertainty. Agile’s iterative
      approach enables the team to respond quickly to changes in the project’s
      requirements and deliver working software in short cycles. For Web
      development projects, I may use Waterfall, as it provides a structured
      approach and ensures that each phase is completed before moving on to the
      next one.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-top: 3pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: left"><br /></p>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 5pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: left">
      Step 3: Team Building and Resource Allocation
    </h3>
    <p style="padding-top: 5pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: left"><br /></p>
    <p class="s1"
	style="
		padding-top: 4pt;
		padding-left: 5pt;
		text-indent: 0pt;
		line-height: 156%;
		text-align: justify;
	"
    >
      Once the methodology is selected, I focus on building a strong team with
      the right skills and expertise. This involves identifying the necessary
      resources, including personnel, equipment, and software. I ensure that
      each team member understands their role and responsibilities and that they
      are equipped to deliver their tasks effectively.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-top: 3pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: left"><br /></p>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 5pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: left">
      Step 4: Project Execution
    </h3>
    <p style="padding-top: 5pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: left"><br /></p>
    <p class="s1"
	style="

		padding-left: 5pt;
		text-indent: 0pt;
		line-height: 156%;
		text-align: justify;
	"
    >
      With the team in place, I focus on executing the project plan. This
      involves breaking down the project into smaller tasks, creating a
      schedule, and assigning resources to each task. I monitor the project’s
      progress regularly, identifying and addressing any issues or roadblocks
      that may arise.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-top: 3pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: left"><br /></p>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 5pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: left">
      Step 5: Monitoring and Control
    </h3>
    <p style="padding-top: 5pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: left"><br /></p>
    <p class="s1"
	style="

		padding-left: 5pt;
		text-indent: 0pt;
		line-height: 156%;
		text-align: justify;
	"
    >
      Throughout the project, I continuously monitor and control its progress.
      This involves tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), such as project
      schedule, budget, and quality. I also ensure that the team is following
      the agreed-upon methodology and that any deviations are addressed
      promptly.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-top: 2pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: left"><br /></p>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 5pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: left">
      Step 6: Quality Assurance
    </h3>

		padding-left: 5pt;
		text-indent: 0pt;
		line-height: 156%;
		text-align: justify;
	"
    >
      Quality assurance is a critical aspect of project management. I ensure
      that the project deliverables meet the required standards and that the
      team is following best practices in software development. This involves conducting regular code reviews, testing, and
      quality assurance activities.
    </p>

    <p style="padding-top: 3pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: left"><br /></p>

		line-height: 156%;
		text-align: justify;
	"
    >
      Once the project is complete, I focus on closing it out effectively. This
      involves documenting the project’s outcomes, conducting a post-project
      review, and ensuring that all stakeholders are satisfied with the results.
      I also ensure that the project’s lessons learned are documented and
      applied to future projects.

      	As the software development process progresses, the cost to repair bugs
        increases significantly. Initially, when bugs are caught and addressed
        early in the development cycle, the time and effort required for fixing
        them are relatively low. However, as the project moves into later
        stages, especially in the traditional Waterfall model, the
        identification of bugs becomes more costly.

            the codebase is smaller and less complex. However, as the software
            grows more intricate, detecting and isolating bugs becomes more
            time-consuming and requires more extensive testing.</span

          <span class="p"

      In an Agile environment, where feedback and testing occur continuously

      increase as the project progresses, but the likelihood of identifying
      major issues earlier minimizes the overall impact. However, in the
      Waterfall model, where testing typically occurs toward the end of the
      process, the cost of bug repair escalates substantially as the potential
      for rework and project delays rises.

	  framework is one of the most popular project management frameworks
	  used by business owners, software developers, teams, and project
	  managers. Some benefits of using the agile framework for your projects include superior product quality, higher
	  customer satisfaction, and better-quality control.
<br>
<br>
      This agile project management framework is best used for complex projects like software development. With the Scrum framework, tasks are 
	  broken down into sprints for better accountability and teamwork. You can use Scrum boards to visualize your project management process and track your project progress.

	  The critical path method offers a step-by-step guide used by project managers to plan project 
processes by defining tasks according to how crucial they are to deliver on the project objectives. This method determines the longest series of linked tasks in a project. When these tasks are finished promptly, the project can be concluded as soon as possible. It also pinpoints tasks that can run concurrently with critical tasks, allowing for additional time flexibility. By focusing on tasks without extra time and managing other tasks accordingly, project managers can effectively ensure projects move forward towards timely completion.

		Kanban teams use a Kanban board to visualize and optimize their workflow. Physical boards are common, but virtual boards are essential for agile software development because they enable traceability, collaboration, and remote access.
		Whether a team uses a digital or physical Kanban board, it helps them visualize their work, standardize their workflow, and quickly identify and resolve blockers and dependencies. 
		<br>
		<br>
		A basic Kanban board has three columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done. Teams can customize the workflow to fit their specific processes based on factors like team size, structure, and objectives.
		The Kanban methodology relies on complete transparency of work and real-time communication. The Kanban board serves as the single source of truth for the team's work..

	To close my data science and AI project, I will first wrap up any ongoing tasks and complete any unfinished
	 work. Next, I will document the project, including the methodology, results, and any lessons learned.
	  This will help me and others understand the project better and apply its lessons in the future. Finally, 
	  I will communicate the project closure with stakeholders, including any team members, clients, or investors. 
	  This may involve writing a report, presenting at a meeting, or simply sending an email. Closing the project
	   effectively can help me move on to new opportunities and make the transition smoother for all involved.
